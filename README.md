# ArchaeoPhases
Tools for the post-processing of the Markov Chain simulated by any software used for the construction of archeological chronologies


ArchaeoPhases provides a list of functions for the statistical analysis of archaeological dates and groups of dates. It is based on the post-processing of the Markov Chains whose stationary distribution is the posterior distribution of a series of dates. Such MCMC output can be simulated by different applications as for instance 'ChronoModel' (see <http://www.chronomodel.fr>), 'Oxcal' (see <https://c14.arch.ox.ac.uk/oxcal.html>) or BCal (see <http://bcal.shef.ac.uk/>). 
The only requirement is to have a CSV file containing a sample from the posterior distribution.


If this is your first time using 'ArchaeoPhases', take a moment reading the vignettes we wrote about the main functions. If you have any questions, feel free to contact us (anne.philippe@univ-nantes.fr).

ArchaeoPhases is currently developed by Anne Philippe member of the Laboratoire de mathématiques Jean Leray, Université de Nantes, France, and by Thomas S. Dye from T. S. Dye & Colleagues, Archaeologists, Inc., Honolulu.
