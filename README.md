# ArchaeoPhases
Tools for the post-processing of the Markov Chain simulated by any software used for the construction of archeological chronologies


ArchaeoPhases provides functions for the statistical analysis of archaeological dates and groups of dates. It is based on the post-processing of the Markov Chains whose stationary distribution is the posterior distribution of a series of dates. Such MCMC output can be simulated by different applications as for instance [ChronoModel](http://www.chronomodel.fr), [Oxcal](https://c14.arch.ox.ac.uk/oxcal.html), or [BCal](http://bcal.shef.ac.uk/).  The only requirement is to have a CSV file containing a sample from the posterior distribution.


If this is your first time using 'ArchaeoPhases', take a moment to read the vignettes we wrote about the main functions. If you have any questions, feel free to contact us (anne.philippe@univ-nantes.fr).

ArchaeoPhases is currently developed by Anne Philippe member of the Laboratoire de mathématiques Jean Leray, Université de Nantes, France, and by Thomas S. Dye, University of Hawai`i, in Honolulu.
