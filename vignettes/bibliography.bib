  abstract = {Abstract. Accurate time series representation of paleoclimatic proxy records is challenging because such records involve dating errors in addition to proxy measurement errors. Rigorous attention is rarely given to age uncertainties in paleoclimatic research, although the latter can severely bias the results of proxy record analysis. Here, we introduce a Bayesian approach to represent layer-counted proxy records – such as ice cores, sediments, corals, or tree rings – as sequences of probability distributions on absolute, error-free time axes. The method accounts for both proxy measurement errors and uncertainties arising from layer-counting-based dating of the records. An application to oxygen isotope ratios from the North Greenland Ice Core Project (NGRIP) record reveals that the counting errors, although seemingly small, lead to substantial uncertainties in the final representation of the oxygen isotope ratios. In particular, for the older parts of the NGRIP record, our results show that the total uncertainty originating from dating errors has been seriously underestimated. Our method is next applied to deriving the overall uncertainties of the Suigetsu radiocarbon comparison curve, which was recently obtained from varved sediment cores at Lake Suigetsu, Japan. This curve provides the only terrestrial radiocarbon comparison for the time interval 12.5–52.8\,kyr\,BP. The uncertainties derived here can be readily employed to obtain complete error estimates for arbitrary radiometrically dated proxy records of this recent part of the last glacial interval.},

Similarities in early UP lithic technology and material culture suggest population dispersals between the Levant and Europe around 50,000–40,000 cal B.P. Our data confirm the presence of modern humans carrying a UP toolkit in the Levant prior to any known European modern human fossils and allow rejection of recent claims that European UP modern humans predate those in the Levant. This result, in turn, suggests the Levant served as a corridor for the dispersal of modern humans out of Africa and into Eurasia.                        ,                             Modern human dispersal into Europe is thought to have occurred with the start of the Upper Paleolithic around 50,000–40,000 y ago. The Levantine corridor hypothesis suggests that modern humans from Africa spread into Europe via the Levant. Ksâr ‘Akil (Lebanon), with its deeply stratified Initial (IUP) and Early (EUP) Upper Paleolithic sequence containing modern human remains, has played an important part in the debate. The latest chronology for the site, based on AMS radiocarbon dates of shell ornaments, suggests that the appearance of the Levantine IUP is later than the start of the first Upper Paleolithic in Europe, thus questioning the Levantine corridor hypothesis. Here we report a series of AMS radiocarbon dates on the marine gastropod               Phorcus turbinatus               associated with modern human remains and IUP and EUP stone tools from Ksâr ‘Akil. Our results, supported by an evaluation of individual sample integrity, place the EUP layer containing the skeleton known as “Egbert” between 43,200 and 42,900 cal B.P. and the IUP-associated modern human maxilla known as “Ethelruda” before ∼45,900 cal B.P. This chronology is in line with those of other Levantine IUP and EUP sites and demonstrates that the presence of modern humans associated with Upper Paleolithic toolkits in the Levant predates all modern human fossils from Europe. The age of the IUP-associated Ethelruda fossil is significant for the spread of modern humans carrying the IUP into Europe and suggests a rapid initial colonization of Europe by our species.},

  abstract = {If radiocarbon measurements are to be used at all for chronological purposes, we have to use statistical methods for calibration. The most widely used method of calibration can be seen as a simple application of Bayesian statistics, which uses both the information from the new measurement and information from the               14               C calibration curve. In most dating applications, however, we have larger numbers of               14               C measurements and we wish to relate those to events in the past. Bayesian statistics provides a coherent framework in which such analysis can be performed and is becoming a core element in many               14               C dating projects. This article gives an overview of the main model components used in chronological analysis, their mathematical formulation, and examples of how such analyses can be performed using the latest version of the OxCal software (v4). Many such models can be put together, in a modular fashion, from simple elements, with defined constraints and groupings. In other cases, the commonly used “uniform phase” models might not be appropriate, and ramped, exponential, or normal distributions of events might be more useful. When considering analyses of these kinds, it is useful to be able run simulations on synthetic data. Methods for performing such tests are discussed here along with other methods of diagnosing possible problems with statistical models of this kind.},

  abstract = {Increase in rainfall during the early Holocene has been reported from different regions of Indian subcontinent, although the magnitude shows spatial variability with lower change in higher rainfall regions and vice versa. While the early-Holocene rainfall records are available from lowland areas of the Indian sub-continent, the record is poorly documented from the high-altitude Central Himalayan region where orography plays an important role in the spatial variability in the rainfall pattern. For the first time, δD               C29               , δ               13               C               C29               values of alkane and δ               13               C values of organic matter from a relict lake of Benital area in the Central Himalaya have been used to reconstruct monsoonal rainfall and contemporary vegetation for last 10.5 ka with an emphasis on the early Holocene. The δD               C29               values suggest that the early Holocene was characterized by a wet phase at ca. 9 ka with 25\% higher rainfall compared to present while the middle-late-Holocene was relatively arid. The estimated increase in monsoonal rainfall for the early Holocene is the highest compared to the previous report from elsewhere. The magnitude of early-Holocene rainfall estimated in this study suggests that in addition to erosion of the bed-rocks at the head-water region, increased stream power reworked the older floodplain and resulted in 2.3 times higher sediment discharged into the Ganges-Brahmaputra (GB) delta compared to the present discharge. The δ               13               C               C29               values of the lake sediments suggest a transition from woody to non-woody plant assemblages occurred at 7 ka. The poor correlation between δD               C29               and δ               13               C               C29               values suggests at higher rainfall, the δ               13               C               C29               values of catchment vegetation were less responsive.},
