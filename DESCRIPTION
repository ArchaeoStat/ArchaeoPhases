Description: Provides a list of functions for the statistical
    analysis of archaeological dates and groups of dates. It is based on
    the post-processing of the Markov Chains whose stationary distribution
    is the posterior distribution of a series of dates. Such output can be
    simulated by different applications as for instance 'ChronoModel' (see
    <https://chronomodel.com/>), 'Oxcal' (see
    <https://c14.arch.ox.ac.uk/oxcal.html>) or 'BCal' (see
    <https://bcal.shef.ac.uk/>). The only requirement is to have a csv
    file containing a sample from the posterior distribution.  Note that
    this package interacts with data available through the
    'ArchaeoPhases.dataset' package which is available in a separate
    repository.  The size of the 'ArchaeoPhases.dataset' package is
    approximately 4 MB.
