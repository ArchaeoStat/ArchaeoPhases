Description: Provides a list of functions for the statistical analysis of archaeological dates and groups of dates. It is based on the post-processing of the Markov Chains whose stationary distribution is the posterior distribution of a series of dates. Such output can be simulated by different applications as for instance 'ChronoModel' (see <https://chronomodel.com/>), 'Oxcal' (see <https://c14.arch.ox.ac.uk/oxcal.html>) or 'BCal' (see <https://bcal.shef.ac.uk/>). The only requirement is to have a csv file containing a sample from the posterior distribution.  Note that this package interacts with data available through the 'ArchaeoPhases.dataset' package which is available in a separate repository.  The size of the 'ArchaeoPhases.dataset' package is approximately 4 MB.
